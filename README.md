Beep Boop Machine

Code review # 3 for Epicodus

By: Chris Rudnicky

Description:

This program will ask the user to input a number. The number is run through several functions that will alter the displayed output depending on several rules. See the specs below for more information:

Specs:

Behavior 1:
The user inputs a number and a range of numbers is created up to the inputted number.
Input: 6
Expected output: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Behavior 2:
A number that contains 0 should be outputted as the string "Beep"
Input: 101
Expected output: Beep

Behavior 3:
A number that contains 0 should be outputted as the string "Boop"
Input: 111
Expected output: Boop

Behavior 4:
A number that is divisible by 3 should return a string of text that says I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.
Input: 30
Expected output: I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.

Known Bugs:

As of 1:13pm 10/26 the app will work only up to the number 10 before the app loses the ability to recognize if a number contains a zero or a one.
